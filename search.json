    "text": "There are five main data structures in R which differ on their dimensions (one dimension, two dimensions, n dimensions) and the type of the elements they are containing (same type, different types):1\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneous\nHeterogeneous\n\n\n\n\n1d\natomic vector\nlist\n\n\n2d\nmatrix\ndata.frame\n\n\nnd\narray\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the two we will use mostly throughout this workshop:\n\n\nAtomic vectors (from here on only called vectors) contain elements of only the same type:\n\nnum_vec &lt;- c(2023, 8, 8)\nnum_vec\n\n[1] 2023    8    8\n\nchar_vec &lt;- c(\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"vec\", \".\")\nchar_vec\n\n[1] \"This\" \"is\"   \"a\"    \"vec\"  \".\"   \n\nlog_vec &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)\nlog_vec\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n\nIf we take a look at the structure of the vectors we have just created, we see se a short description of the data type we are dealing with in front of the vector:\n\nstr(num_vec)\n\n num [1:3] 2023 8 8\n\nstr(char_vec)\n\n chr [1:5] \"This\" \"is\" \"a\" \"vec\" \".\"\n\nstr(log_vec)\n\n logi [1:2] TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThe first one is num (numeric) so it only stores numeric values. The second one is char (character), so it only can contain strings. And last but not least we have logi (logical) for boolean values. Why is that important? Well, some functions only make sense for specific data types. For example:\n\nmean(char_vec)\n\nWarning in mean.default(char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\ngives us a warning, because the input has the wrong format.\nBy the way, strings are just ‘words’ combined of multiple characters. We can combine multiple strings by using paste() or paste0() (the first one leaves a space between the words, the second one not):\n\nvec_1 &lt;- \"My value\"\nvec_2 &lt;- \"is:\"\nvalue &lt;- 10\n\n\npaste(vec_1, vec_2, value)\n\n[1] \"My value is: 10\"\n\npaste0(vec_1, vec_2, value)\n\n[1] \"My valueis:10\"\n\n\nThis will come in handy later when we write our own functions, because it helps us to print variable messages, depending on the input given by the user.\n\n\n\n\nA data frame is two dimensional and can store elements of different types.\n\npersons &lt;- data.frame(name = c(\"Anna\", \"Alex\", \"John\", \"Jessi\"),\n                      age = c(19, 17, 18, 18),\n                      birth_month = c(\"Jan\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Mar\"),\n                      big5_extro = c(3.5, 2, 4.5, 4.2)\n                      )\n\nNote that we do nothing else here than combining vectors to a data frame. Each vector will be one column, with an assigned column name.\n\n\nAdding new columns to a data frame is pretty straight forward. We just define the column name, and then assign it some input. For example, we could add a column with the neuroticsm ratings for each person:\n\npersons$big5_neuro &lt;- c(1, 3, 2, 4)\npersons\n\n   name age birth_month big5_extro big5_neuro\n1  Anna  19         Jan        3.5          1\n2  Alex  17         Sep        2.0          3\n3  John  18         Oct        4.5          2\n4 Jessi  18         Mar        4.2          4\n\n\nOr, using the tidyverse with the help of mutate():\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npersons &lt;- persons %&gt;% \n  mutate(big5_agree= c(2, 5, 2, 1) )\n\n\n\n\n\nA special type of data frame are the so called tibbles. Tibbles are a modern version of data frames and the standard data frame type of the tidyverse, as they have some advantageous characteristics (e.g., note the more informative printing of the data frame). So don’t be confused if you run into them, in general they behave like data frames.\n\n\npersons_tibble &lt;- tibble(\n  name = c(\"Anna\", \"Alex\", \"John\", \"Jessi\"),\n  age = c(19, 17, 18, 18),\n  birth_month = c(\"Jan\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Mar\"),\n  big5_extro = c(3.5, 2, 4.5, 4.2)\n)\npersons_tibble\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  name    age birth_month big5_extro\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Anna     19 Jan                3.5\n2 Alex     17 Sep                2  \n3 John     18 Oct                4.5\n4 Jessi    18 Mar                4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list is a one dimensional object, which can, unlike a vector, contain elements of different types, but also of different lengths. For example, we can store a vectors of different lengths and data frames in a list, which makes it the most versatile data structure:\n\npersonality_rating &lt;- list(\n     big5 = data.frame(name = c(\"Jessi\", \"John\"),\n                       extraversion = c(4.3, 2), \n                       openness = c(3.8, NA)),\n     rating_type = \"self_rating\"\n     )\npersonality_rating\n\n$big5\n   name extraversion openness\n1 Jessi          4.3      3.8\n2  John          2.0       NA\n\n$rating_type\n[1] \"self_rating\"\n\n\nHere, we define the list personality_ratings, which includes a data frame with the personality rating, and some meta information in the form of a character vector, describing the rating type. We won’t use it much in this workshop, but keep in mind it exists, as it quickly becomes necessary for managing more complex tasks.\n\n\n\nFinally, just for the sake of comprehensiveness (we won’t use them in the following workshop, but that doesn’t mean they are irrelevant):\n\nmy_matrix &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,\"3\",4), \n                    nrow = 2, \n                    ncol = 2\n                    )\n\nmy_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,] \"1\"  \"3\" \n[2,] \"2\"  \"4\" \n\n\nNote how everything gets converted to character (with the “” around it), because we used a \"3\" instead of 3? That’s because a matrix can only have values of the same type.\nLast but not least, just so you have seen it once:\n\nmy_array &lt;- array(1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4))\nmy_array\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    7    9   11\n[2,]    8   10   12\n\n, , 3\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   13   15   17\n[2,]   14   16   18\n\n, , 4\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   19   21   23\n[2,]   20   22   24\n\n\nBy using the dim argument I specify that each matrix in this array has 2 rows, 3 columns, and that I want 4 matrices.",

This way, your code will still work if the column position changes.\n\n\n\n\nRows & Columns\nAnd of course we can combine both calls:\n\nathletes[c(1, 4), c(2, 4)]\n\n      ID Sex\n1 132181   M\n4    502   M\n\nathletes[c(1, 4), c(\"Year\", \"Sport\")]\n\n  Year  Sport\n1 1956 Hockey\n4 1956 Hockey\n\n\nWe can also use Boolean values (every row/column must get a value here, so we extract the first 100 rows by repeating TRUE 100 times, and than add FALSE for the remaining rows):\n\nstr(athletes[c(rep(TRUE, 100), rep(FALSE, 271016)), ])\n\n'data.frame':   100 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ NOC   : chr  \"AFG\" \"AFG\" \"AFG\" \"AFG\" ...\n $ ID    : int  132181 87371 44977 502 109153 29626 1076 121376 80210 87374 ...\n $ Name  : chr  \"Najam Yahya\" \"Ahmad Jahan Nuristani\" \"Mohammad Halilula\" \"Ahmad Shah Abouwi\" ...\n $ Sex   : chr  \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ Age   : int  NA NA 28 NA 24 28 28 NA NA NA ...\n $ Height: int  NA NA 163 NA NA 168 NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Weight: num  NA NA 57 NA 74 73 NA NA 57 NA ...\n $ Team  : chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" ...\n $ Games : chr  \"1956 Summer\" \"1948 Summer\" \"1980 Summer\" \"1956 Summer\" ...\n $ Year  : int  1956 1948 1980 1956 1964 1960 1936 1956 1972 1956 ...\n $ Season: chr  \"Summer\" \"Summer\" \"Summer\" \"Summer\" ...\n $ City  : chr  \"Melbourne\" \"London\" \"Moskva\" \"Melbourne\" ...\n $ Sport : chr  \"Hockey\" \"Hockey\" \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\" ...\n $ Event : chr  \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" \"Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle\" \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" ...\n $ Medal : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Region: chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nInstead of writing 271016 we should actually use the current row number, in case that changes as well:\n\nstr(athletes[c(rep(TRUE, 100), rep(FALSE, nrow(athletes) - 100)), ])\n\n'data.frame':   100 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ NOC   : chr  \"AFG\" \"AFG\" \"AFG\" \"AFG\" ...\n $ ID    : int  132181 87371 44977 502 109153 29626 1076 121376 80210 87374 ...\n $ Name  : chr  \"Najam Yahya\" \"Ahmad Jahan Nuristani\" \"Mohammad Halilula\" \"Ahmad Shah Abouwi\" ...\n $ Sex   : chr  \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ Age   : int  NA NA 28 NA 24 28 28 NA NA NA ...\n $ Height: int  NA NA 163 NA NA 168 NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Weight: num  NA NA 57 NA 74 73 NA NA 57 NA ...\n $ Team  : chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" ...\n $ Games : chr  \"1956 Summer\" \"1948 Summer\" \"1980 Summer\" \"1956 Summer\" ...\n $ Year  : int  1956 1948 1980 1956 1964 1960 1936 1956 1972 1956 ...\n $ Season: chr  \"Summer\" \"Summer\" \"Summer\" \"Summer\" ...\n $ City  : chr  \"Melbourne\" \"London\" \"Moskva\" \"Melbourne\" ...\n $ Sport : chr  \"Hockey\" \"Hockey\" \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\" ...\n $ Event : chr  \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" \"Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle\" \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" ...\n $ Medal : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Region: chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional filtering\nNow the stuff we looked at in logical operators comes in handy! We can filter rows which match some condition. For example, we might want to look at all athletes from Germany:\n\nathletes[athletes$Team == \"Germany\", ]\n\n       NOC     ID\n107246 GER   7385\n107247 GER 114424\n107248 GER 112937\n107249 GER 107870\n107250 GER   9399\n107252 GER   9398\n107253 GER  47318\n107254 GER  96348\n107255 GER 127340\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfold if you want to take a closer look at what’s happening here\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a close look at the comparison before the ,:\n\nathletes$Team == \"Germany\"\n\n    [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n...\n\n\nathletes$Team is a vector, so comparing its values to a specified value yields a logical vector with the respective TRUE and FALSE values. We can insert this logical vector in front of the , to extract all rows corresponding to that condition.\n\n\n\nIf we want to extract multiple nationalities at once, we need the %in% operator:\n\nathletes[athletes$Team %in% c(\"Kenya\", \"Norway\"), ]\n\n       NOC     ID                                                          Name\n156375 KEN  60617                                               Nixon Kiprotich\n156376 KEN  85669                                             Benjamin Ngaruiya\n156377 KEN  60620                                    Wilson Arap Chuma Kiprugut\n156378 KEN  87843                                                Maisiba Obwoge\n156379 KEN  20521                                             Charles Cheruiyot\n156380 KEN  20524                               Rose Jelagat Cheruiyot (-Kirui)\n156381 KEN  60610                                          Asbel Kipruto Kiprop\n156382 KEN  90229                                             Janet Owino Awour\n156383 KEN  89053                                             Ahmed Rajab Omari\n...\n\n\nBy the way, if we want to save our extracted data frame, we can assign it a new name (otherwise it will only get printed into the console, but we can’t go on working with it):\n\nathletes_team &lt;- athletes[athletes$Team %in% c(\"Kenya\", \"Norway\"), ]\nhead(athletes_team)\n\n       NOC    ID                            Name Sex Age Height Weight  Team\n156375 KEN 60617                 Nixon Kiprotich   M  29    185     68 Kenya\n156376 KEN 85669               Benjamin Ngaruiya   M  24     NA     NA Kenya\n156377 KEN 60620      Wilson Arap Chuma Kiprugut   M  NA    178     71 Kenya\n156378 KEN 87843                  Maisiba Obwoge   M  28    175     99 Kenya\n156379 KEN 20521               Charles Cheruiyot   M  19    165     54 Kenya\n156380 KEN 20524 Rose Jelagat Cheruiyot (-Kirui)   F  24    154     48 Kenya\n             Games Year Season        City     Sport\n156375 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona Athletics\n156376 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona    Boxing\n...\n\n\nWe can also combine multiple logical vectors using & (“and”) and | (“or”). For example, we might want to look at all german athletes before the year 2000:\n\nathletes_2 &lt;- athletes[athletes$Team == \"Germany\" & athletes$Year &lt; 2000, ]\nhead(athletes_2)\n\n       NOC     ID                   Name Sex Age Height Weight    Team\n107246 GER   7385     Dirk Peter Balster   M  26    195     90 Germany\n107247 GER 114424 Kathleen Stark (-Kern)   F  16    166     51 Germany\n107250 GER   9399     Petra Behle-Schaaf   F  23    177     67 Germany\n107252 GER   9398 Jochen Friedrich Behle   M  37    183     73 Germany\n107253 GER  47318          Martin Heinze   M  21    172     73 Germany\n107254 GER  96348        Ramona Portwich   F  25    175     70 Germany\n             Games Year Season        City                Sport\n107246 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona               Rowing\n107247 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona           Gymnastics\n107250 1992 Winter 1992 Winter Albertville             Biathlon\n107252 1998 Winter 1998 Winter      Nagano Cross Country Skiing\n107253 1960 Summer 1960 Summer        Roma            Wrestling\n107254 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona             Canoeing\n                                            Event Medal  Region\n107246                 Rowing Men's Coxless Fours  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107247             Gymnastics Women's Uneven Bars  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107250     Biathlon Women's 7.5 kilometres Sprint  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107252   Cross Country Skiing Men's 10 kilometres  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107253    Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107254 Canoeing Women's Kayak Doubles, 500 metres  Gold Germany\n\n\nOr at all judo athletes weighting over 100 or under 50 kg:\n\nathletes_3 &lt;- athletes[(athletes$Sport == \"Judo\") & (athletes$Weight &gt; 100 | athletes$Weight &lt; 50), ]\nhead(athletes_3)\n\n      NOC    ID                Name  Sex Age Height Weight    Team       Games\nNA   &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.1 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.2 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.3 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\n471   ALG 13895 Mohamed Bouaichaoui    M  25    178    120 Algeria 2004 Summer\nNA.4 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\n     Year Season   City Sport                  Event Medal  Region\nNA     NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.1   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.2   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.3   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n471  2004 Summer Athina  Judo Judo Men's Heavyweight  &lt;NA&gt; Algeria\nNA.4   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nHmm, that looks a bit weird. Some rows only contain NA values. That’s because there are missing values in the Weight column. We will look at that closer in the missings chapter and ignore that problem for now.\nIn the long run, always having to specify the name of the data frame for each column or row with condition can become a bit annoying and clutters the code. Also this code leaves all rows with missing values…\nInstead, we can use the filter() function from the tidyverse:\n\n\nRows: Tidyverse\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nathletes %&gt;%\n  filter(Sport == \"Judo\", (Weight &gt; 100 | Weight &lt; 50))\n\n    NOC     ID                                 Name Sex Age Height Weight\n1   ALG  13895                  Mohamed Bouaichaoui   M  25    178  120.0\n2   ALG  82643                        Meriem Moussa   F  20    150   48.0\n3   ALG  80035                      Boualem Miloudi   M  23    192  106.0\n...\n\n\n\nNote how we can just write our conditions without connecting them with & (filter() does that automatically for us). Also, we don’t have to put the column names into \"\", because filter() knows that this are column names of the athletes data frame, which makes coding a bit more pleasant. And finally, missing rows are automatically removed, which makes sense in many cases!\n\n\nColumns: Tidyverse\nFor extracting columns, we need select():\n\n\nathletes %&gt;%\n  select(Year, Sport)\n\n      Year                     Sport\n1     1956                    Hockey\n2     1948                    Hockey\n3     1980                 Wrestling\n...",

It’s pretty straight forward: we just put the position of the element we want to extract behind the vector in square brackets (without a ,, as we only have a one dimensional object). Let’s quickly define a vector for illustration:\n\nvec_sport &lt;- athletes$Sport # remember: `$` returns a vector\n\nAnd look at the second element:\n\nvec_sport[2]\n\n[1] \"Hockey\"\n\n\nOf course we can also do that for multiple elements:\n\nvec_sport[c(2, 3, 4)]\n\n[1] \"Hockey\"    \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\"   \n\n## Or, less to write:\nvec_sport[2:4]\n\n[1] \"Hockey\"    \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\"   \n\n\nAnother way would be to provide a logical vector, which defines for each position if we want to extract the element or not (like we already did for data frames):\n\nvec_sport[c(rep(TRUE, 100), rep(FALSE, 65))]\n\n    [1] \"Hockey\"                    \"Hockey\"                   \n    [3] \"Wrestling\"                 \"Hockey\"                   \n    [5] \"Wrestling\"                 \"Wrestling\"                \n    [7] \"Hockey\"                    \"Hockey\"                   \n...",

    "text": "Exercises: Fictional characters\n2\nOver the course of this workshop, you can work on exercises to put the theoretical knowledge you acquired in the chapters to use. Most of these exercises will use the characters data set, which contains psychometric ratings for different fictional characters, rated by a large number of people on a personality scale developed by the author of the questionnaire.\nYou will load the data, prepare it for analyses and also plot it in the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\nThe goal for the exercise part of this workshop is to build a character profile for a fictional universe of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe have looked at how to download these data sets in the this exercise.",

Did that work as expected? If not, why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the .csv file by opening it in a text editor. Look at the documentation of read.csv() and take a look at the sep argument.

that looks weird. If we take a look at the file by opening it in a text editor, we can see that the values are separated by ;. So let’s call the help for read.csv():\n\n?read.csv\n\nThe sep argument specifies that the seperator needs to be a white space (meaning tabs, spaces … - look at the details in the documentation). So, we can do the following:\n\npsych_stats &lt;- read.csv(\n  file = here::here(\"raw_data\", \"psych_stats.csv\"),\n  sep = \";\"\n)\n\nstr(psych_stats)\n\n'data.frame':   889 obs. of  365

    "text": "Exercise 1\nMerge the characters data frame and the psych_stats data frame on a common column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the common columns. Are they named the same in both data frames? Look at the documentation of ?merge to see, how you can merge data frames that don’t have identically named columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let’s take a look at both data sets again:\n\nstr(characters)\n\n'data.frame':   889 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ id        : chr  \"F2\" \"F1\" \"F5\" \"F4\" ...\n $ name      : chr  \"Monica Geller\" \"Rachel Green\" \"Chandler Bing\" \"Joey Tribbiani\" ...\n $ uni_id    : chr  \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" ...\n $ uni_name  : chr  \"Friends\" \"Friends\" \"Friends\" \"Friends\" ...\n $ notability: num  79.7 76.7 74.4 74.3 72.6 51.6 86.5 84.2 82.6 65.6 ...\n $ link      : chr  \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/2\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/1\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/5\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/4\" ...\n $ image_link: chr  \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/2.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/1.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/5.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/4.jpg\" ...\n\nstr(psych_stats)\n\ntibble [323,596 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ char_id : chr [1:323596] \"F2\" \"F2\" \"F2\" \"F2\" ...\n $ question: chr [1:323596] \"messy_neat\" \"disorganized_self.disciplined\" \"diligent_lazy\" \"on.time_tardy\" ...\n $ rating  : num [1:323596] 95.7 95.2 6.1 6.2 6.4 ...\n\n\nIt seems like both data frames have a column containing an ID for the character. We can use that column for merging:\n\ncharacters_stats &lt;- merge(\n  x = characters,\n  y = psych_stats,\n  by.x = \"id\", \n  by.y = \"char_id\"\n)\n\nstr(characters_stats)\n\n'data.frame':   323596 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ id        : chr  \"AD1\" \"AD1\" \"AD1\" \"AD1\" ...\n $ name      : chr  \"Michael Bluth\" \"Michael Bluth\" \"Michael Bluth\" \"Michael Bluth\" ...\n $ uni_id    : chr  \"AD\" \"AD\" \"AD\" \"AD\" ...\n $ uni_name  : chr  \"Arrested Development\" \"Arrested Development\" \"Arrested Development\" \"Arrested Development\" ...\n $ notability: num  76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 76.9 ...\n $ link      : chr  \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/AD/1\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/AD/1\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/AD/1\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/AD/1\" ...\n $ image_link: chr  \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/AD/1.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/AD/1.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/AD/1.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/AD/1.jpg\" ...\n $ question  : chr  \"messy_neat\" \"disorganized_self.disciplined\" \"diligent_lazy\" \"on.time_tardy\" ...\n $ rating    : num  68.6 73.3 10.8 22.2 45.1 16.2 86.3 74.7 15.4 36.2 ...\n\n\nWorked like a charm!",

    "text": "How to write a function?\nEverything that does something in R is a function. We have already used a lot of them, like print(), filter(), merge(). The great thing is: we can define our own functions pretty easily:\nfunction_name &lt;- function(argument_1, argument_2, ...){\n  do some operations\n  \n  return(result)\n}\n\nWe always have to give the function a concise name (often not that easy).\nThen we specify some arguments (which should also have concise names). In our introductory example that was just the athlete name. We can also provide a default option for the arguments, which the function will fall back on if the user doesn’t specify anything.\nInside the { } we define the operations, which can use the variable function arguments so the user can specify some aspects of the function behavior.\nIn the end, it is good practice to return the result by using return(), so it is always clear what the function is giving back to the user.\n\nOne minimal example with three arguments would be to sum three numbers:\n\nsum_num &lt;- function(x, y, z = 0){\n  result &lt;- x + y + z\n  return(result)\n}\n\nsum_num(x = 1, y = 1, z = 2)\n\n[1] 4\n\n## We don't have to use the arguments in order, IF we name them:\nsum_num(y = 2, z = 4, x = 1)\n\n[1] 7\n\n## We don't have to specify z, because the function can use a default:\nsum_num(x = 3, y = 1)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt often makes sense to explicitly write the argument names into your function call. This makes your code clearer, and avoids a mix up.",

Scripts are the files you store your code in. You can execute a line of code by pressing ctrl + enter (on windows) or command + return (on macOS). To execute multiple lines of code at once, mark them before you press the keys. Try it yourself! Write:\n\n# Our first line of code:\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello World!\"\n\n\ninto your script and execute it.

Just merge together the code snippets you have created during this exercise, and test the function with some fictional universes of your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfictional_personalities &lt;- function(fictional_universe, questions) {\n  ## Prepare the data:\n  characters_plot &lt;- characters_stats %&gt;%\n    mutate(question = gsub(\"_\", \"/\", .$question)) %&gt;%\n    filter(\n      uni_name == fictional_universe,\n      question %in% questions\n    )\n\n  ## Merge together the code snippets we already saw in the other exercises.\n  p &lt;- ggplot(\n    data = characters_plot,\n    aes(\n      x = rating,\n      y = question\n    )\n  ) +\n    facet_grid(. ~ name) +\n    geom_col(\n      aes(fill = rating),\n      colour = \"black\",\n      width = 0.5\n    ) +\n    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"D\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    ggtitle(paste(\"Characteristics of the '\", fictional_universe, \"' characters\")) + # paste together the title, so it always shows the correct fictional universe\n    xlab(\"Rating\") +\n    ylab(\"\")\n\n  print(p)\n}\n\n\nNow, let’s try it out:\n\nfictional_personalities(\n  fictional_universe = \"How I Met Your Mother\",\n  questions = unique(characters_stats$question)[1:20]\n) # Use the first 40 questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Sample some questions randomly:\nset.seed(42) # This makes the random sampling reproducable\nrandom_questions &lt;- sample(unique(characters_stats$question), 20)\n\nfictional_personalities(\n  fictional_universe = \"Breaking Bad\",\n  questions = random_questions\n)",

Also note that we are looking at the number of people from each country winning a gold medal, so team sports are counted multiple times.",

The most intuitive way would be to just copy paste the code with changed country names:\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Algeria\", \"n\"], \n    \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Algeria\", \"Region\"], \n    \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"5 Olympic gold medalists are from Algeria.\"\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Argentina\", \"n\"], \n    \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Argentina\", \"Region\"], \n    \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"91 Olympic gold medalists are from Argentina.\"\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Armenia\", \"n\"], \n    \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Armenia\", \"Region\"], \n    \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"2 Olympic gold medalists are from Armenia.\"\n\nprint(\n  paste0(medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Australia\", \"n\"], \n         \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n         medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Australia\", \"Region\"],\n         \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"368 Olympic gold medalists are from Australia.\"\n\n\nThis could go on …\nHere we paste together a sentence consisting of data and some pre specified character strings, which we then print into the console.

A for loop is generally constructed like this:\nfor(counter in values){\n  repeat something with changing counter\n}\nWhat does this mean? Let’s look at a simple example first. We want to multiply the values from 10 to 20 with 100 and then print them into our console:\n\nfor(i in 10:20){\n  new_i &lt;- i * 100\n  print(new_i)\n}\n\n[1] 1000\n[1] 1100\n[1] 1200\n[1] 1300\n[1] 1400\n[1] 1500\n[1] 1600\n[1] 1700\n[1] 1800\n[1] 1900\n[1] 2000\n\n\n\nIn the first iteration, i takes the value of the first vector element behind in, which is 10.\nThe operation in the loop body gets executed, in this case the current value gets multiplied by 100 and then printed into the console.\nAfter the operation is finished, i takes the next value, in this case 11, and the whole process starts again.\nThe loop is finished after the operation on the last value has been executed, in this case 20.\n\nLet’s get back to our initial example. Try to figure out what happens here by yourself. What is the first and the last value i gets assigned?\n\nfor(i in unique(medal_counts$Region)){\n  print(\n    paste0(\n      medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == i, \"n\"], \n      \" Olympic gold

Still, sometimes for-loops are the better option, depending on the use case. Also, their structure is pretty much the same over many programming languages.",

our condition. Then, inside the { } we define an operation that gets executed, if this condition is met. Inside the else{ } part we define an operation that gets executed if the condition in if() is not met.\nIn our inital example we check if the number of gold medalists is equal to one. If that is the case, we print the specific statement. If not, we print the other.\nWe don’t even need to define the else{} part if nothing should happen in case the if() condition is not met.",

That’s why we don’t have to specify the vector within the mean() function.\nIf we want to clearly state which of the function arguments should receive the input, we can write a ., which can be read as output of the previous function call.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s take a quick look at the most important basic operations in R. You can also use a cheat sheet to keep an overview during the course.\n\n\nWe can use R as a calculator:\n\n(1 + 2) * 3^2\n2 - 3/log(8)\n\n\n\n\nWe can create objects in R by using the assignment operator &lt;-, which assigns a value to an object:\n\n## Assign the result of 1 + 1 to the object 'result':\nresult &lt;- 1 + 1\nresult\n\n[1] 2\n\n## Assign the result of the comparison to the object 'log_result':\nlog_result &lt;- 10 &gt; 1\nlog_result\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine multiple elements to build a new one:\n\nnew_element &lt;- c(1, 10, 15)\n\nIn this case, this new element is a vector, which is a one dimensional collection of values. The c() stands for combine, or concatenate, and is the basic function for building a vector out of single elements.\n\n\n\nThe boolean variables in R are TRUE and FALSE. Comparison operators return either TRUE or FALSE:\n\n1 &lt; 2\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# But:\n2 &lt; 1\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThese are the comparison operators you will typically use:\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n&lt;=\nless or equal\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater or equal\n\n\n%in%\npart of\n\n\n\n\n\nMainly we will use these logical operations to check which elements in a vector satisfy some requirements:\n\n# Build a vector of numbers ranging from 1 to 10\nvec_num &lt;- 1:10\n\n# Check which of these numbers are smaller than 5\nvec_num &lt; 5\n\n [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nThis will become important later on, when we want to subset vectors and data frames to extract only those values that satisfy some requirements we’ve defined.\n\n\n\nThe %in% operator is used to check for each element of its first argument if it is part of the second argument:\n\nc(\"Monica\", \"Rachel\", \"Barny\") %in% c(\"Monica\", \"Rachel\", \"Ross\", \"Joey\", \"Phoebe\", \"Chandler\")\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can invert boolean values by using !:\n\n!TRUE\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n!(1 &gt; 100)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also combine multiple logical operations by using | (“or”) and/or & (“and”):\n\nTRUE & FALSE\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nTRUE | FALSE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n(10 &lt; 20 | \"a\" == \"b\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n(10 &lt; 20 & \"a\" == \"b\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n!(10 &lt; 20 & \"a\" == \"b\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything that does something in R is a function. A function call has the form: functionname(argument1 = value, argument2 = value, ...). One basic example is the function that can calculate the square root:\n\nsqrt(4)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nWe can also assign the name of the function argument to our value. This is clearer, as we don’t rely on the order of the function arguments:\n\nrep(4, 10)\n\n [1] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nwill rep 4 10 times. If we swap the arguments, the 10 will be repeated 4 times:\n\nrep(10, 4)\n\n[1] 10 10 10 10\n\n\nBut if we specify which value belongs to which function argument, the order doesn’t matter:\n\nrep(times = 10, x = 4)\n\n [1] 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n\nHow do we know which arguments a function has? By using the documentation:\n\n\n\nOne of the most important functions in R is the help-function ?:\n\n?rep\n\nwill open the documentation for the function with the description of its usage, details about the arguments … Take a look and become acquainted with the structure of the function documentation, it is an important tool!",

For our comparison problem, we can add the new condition that all rows that get selected shouldn’t have an NA in the Weight column:\n\nathletes[(athletes$Sport == \"Judo\") & (athletes$Weight &gt; 100 | athletes$Weight &lt; 50) & !is.na(athletes$Weight), ]\n\n       NOC     ID                                 Name Sex Age Height Weight\n471    ALG  13895                  Mohamed Bouaichaoui   M  25    178  120.0\n673    ALG  82643                        Meriem Moussa   F  20    150   48.0\n702    ALG  80035                      Boualem Miloudi   M  23    192  106.0\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfold if you want to take a closer look at what’s happening here\n\n\n\n\n\nLike always when filtering specific rows, we define a logical vector, which has a TRUE for all rows that have a missing on ID and a FALSE for all others (by using the ! operator, which inverts the boolean values - otherwise we would extract all rows with missing values in the Weight column):\n\n!is.na(athletes$Weight)\n\n    [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n   [13]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n   [25]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n   [37]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n...\n\n\nWe also assign the new name athletes_na to the resulting data frame, so we don’t overwrite the original one.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving NA's\nRemoving NA's from a data frame works pretty similar:\n\nathletes_na &lt;- athletes[!is.na(athletes$Weight), ]\nhead(athletes_na)\n\n   NOC     ID                 Name Sex Age Height Weight        Team\n3  AFG  44977    Mohammad Halilula   M  28    163     57 Afghanistan\n5  AFG 109153   Shakar Khan Shakar   M  24     NA     74 Afghanistan\n6  AFG  29626 Sultan Mohammad Dost   M  28    168     73 Afghanistan\n9  AFG  80210             Alam Mir   M  NA     NA     57 Afghanistan\n11 AFG 116125 Nizam-ud-din Subhani   M  34    168    111 Afghanistan\n13 AFG 133692    Khojawahid Zahedi   M  20    178     74 Afghanistan\n         Games Year Season   City     Sport\n3  1980 Summer 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling\n5  1964 Summer 1964 Summer  Tokyo Wrestling\n6  1960 Summer 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling\n9  1972 Summer 1972 Summer Munich Wrestling\n11 1960 Summer 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling\n13 1980 Summer 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling\n                                       Event Medal      Region\n3    Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n5    Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n6    Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n9  Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Greco-Roman  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n11    Wrestling Men's Heavyweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n13   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n\n\nOr, using the tidyverse:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nathletes_na &lt;- athletes %&gt;%\n  drop_na(Weight)\nhead(athletes_na)\n\n  NOC     ID                 Name Sex Age Height Weight        Team       Games\n1 AFG  44977    Mohammad Halilula   M  28    163     57 Afghanistan 1980 Summer\n2 AFG 109153   Shakar Khan Shakar   M  24     NA     74 Afghanistan 1964 Summer\n3 AFG  29626 Sultan Mohammad Dost   M  28    168     73 Afghanistan 1960 Summer\n4 AFG  80210             Alam Mir   M  NA     NA     57 Afghanistan 1972 Summer\n5 AFG 116125 Nizam-ud-din Subhani   M  34    168    111 Afghanistan 1960 Summer\n6 AFG 133692    Khojawahid Zahedi   M  20    178     74 Afghanistan 1980 Summer\n  Year Season   City     Sport                                     Event Medal\n1 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n2 1964 Summer  Tokyo Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n3 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n4 1972 Summer Munich Wrestling Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Greco-Roman  &lt;NA&gt;\n5 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling    Wrestling Men's Heavyweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n6 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n       Region\n1 Afghanistan\n2 Afghanistan\n3 Afghanistan\n4 Afghanistan\n5 Afghanistan\n6 Afghanistan\n\n\n\nBoth code versions will remove all rows containing NA's in the weight column.\nAs already stated, it is not always necessary to remove NA's manually from the data set. In other cases it might be feasible to ignore them, and many functions can deal with missing values by themselves.",

It will be a bit harder than the other workshop exercises to challenge you one last time and encourage you to think about concepts you might want to revisit, so don’t worry if some exercises feel a bit harder, we haven’t talked about everything yet.\nIf you already have some R experience, you can do this exercise before the rest of the workshop and use it to identify weak points to follow up on.\nUse all resources at your disposal (cheat sheets, stack overflow …), that’s how you would work on a real project as well.\nSo, in order to provide you with a totally fresh data set, let’s look at beach volleyball. The data was collected from international beach volleyball championships, and displays a lot of stats on each single match.",

One file is a .csv file, the other an SPSS file (.sav).

Use a text editor to take a look into the file itself to find out what the separator should be.

    "text": "Exercise 2\nNow, let’s do a paired t-test comparing the mean winners height against the mean losers height.\n\n1) Histogram\nOne assumption of the paired t-test is that the differences of the pairs are normally distributed. Check this assumption visually by creating a histogram of the winning_height - losing_height difference. Use a for-loop to create one histogram for the men and one for the women. You need to explicitly print() the plot if you want to display it from within a for-loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe start of your for loop should look like this: for(i in c(\"M\", \"W\")){. Inside, filter for men/women, and then create the plot using this subsetted data frame.\nUse geom_histogram() as geom for your plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor (i in c(\"M\", \"W\")) {\n  ## Extract men/women, depending on i\n  vb_gender &lt;- vb %&gt;% filter(gender == i)\n\n  p &lt;- ggplot(\n    ## Build the coordinate system\n    data = vb_gender,\n    mapping = aes(x = winning_height - losing_height)\n  ) +\n    ## Use geom_histogram to build a histogram. Set the binwidth manually, so the bars get a bit smaller:\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)\n\n  ## Explicitly print the plot, so it gets put out from the for loop\n  print(p)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm, so the differences in the mean team height are really small in most cases! One inch are 2.54 cm, and most height differences between the teams are not larger than 5 cm, so we probably won’t see an effect. But let’s proceed to confirm that!\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Paired t-test\nDo a paired t-test comparing the winning teams height vs the losing teams height. Again use a for-loop to test for men and women separately. Save the result in a list, and name the list elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the function t.test() and set the argument paired = \"true\".\nTo save the result in an empty list you have created, use: result_list[[i]] &lt;- calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Define an empty list to save your t-test results in.\nresult_list &lt;- list()\n\n## Iterate over men and women:\nfor (i in c(\"M\", \"W\")) {\n  ## Extract men/women, depending on i\n  vb_gender &lt;- vb %&gt;% filter(gender == i)\n\n  ## Do the t-test and save the result\n  result_list[[i]] &lt;- t.test(vb_gender$winning_height,\n    vb_gender$losing_height,\n    paired = \"true\"\n  )\n}\n\nresult_list\n\n$M\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  vb_gender$winning_height and vb_gender$losing_height\nt = 23.111, df = 32168, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.2439251 0.2891347\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      0.2665299 \n\n\n$W\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  vb_gender$winning_height and vb_gender$losing_height\nt = 16.38, df = 30646, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.1839846 0.2340009\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n      0.2089927 \n\n\nTh p-value is &lt; 0.001 in both subgroups. However, we have a very large sample, so almost all group differences will become significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nActually, this example would be a perfect application for lapply():\n\nresult_list &lt;- lapply(c(\"M\", \"W\"), function(x) {\n  ## Extract men/women\n  vb_gender &lt;- vb %&gt;% filter(gender == x)\n\n  ## Calculate the t-test. Note how we don't need an empty list to save the results in, lapply() does that for us.\n  t_test_result &lt;- t.test(vb_gender$winning_height, vb_gender$losing_height, paired = \"true\")\n\n  ## Explictly return the result:\n  return(t_test_result)\n})\n\n## We still hav to name our resulting list to know what is what:\nnames(result_list) &lt;- c(\"M\", \"W\")\n\nThe output of lapply() is always a list, so we don’t have to define an empty list in the beginning of the loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) Functions\nLook at the mean differences. Not very big, right? Let’s calculate a standardized effect size, Cohen’s d! We can do that for a paired t test by dividing the mean of the differences of both groups by the standard deviation of the difference of both groups:\n\\(d=\\frac{mean_{Diff}}{sd_{Diff}}\\)\nwith Diff as the differences of the paired sample values.\nWrite a function to do that, then add it to your loop so Cohen’s d gets printed into your console. You can use the function lsr::cohensD() to check your function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# install.packages(\"lsr\") # Can be used for checking the own calculation\n\n## Function for calculating Cohen's d\ncohens_d &lt;- function(group_1, group_2) {\n  ## Calculate the difference\n  diff &lt;- group_1 - group_2\n\n  ## Calculate d accoring to our formula\n  d &lt;- mean(diff) / sd(diff)\n\n  return(d)\n}\n\nfor (i in c(\"M\", \"W\")) {\n  ## filter men/women\n  vb_gender &lt;- vb %&gt;% filter(gender == i)\n\n  ## Paired t-test\n  result_list[[i]] &lt;- t.test(vb_gender$winning_height, vb_gender$losing_height, paired = \"true\")\n\n  ## Our Cohen's d function\n  d &lt;- cohens_d(\n    group_1 = vb_gender$winning_height,\n    group_2 = vb_gender$losing_height\n  )\n\n  ## Cohen's d according to the lsr package:\n  d_2 &lt;- lsr::cohensD(\n    x = vb_gender$winning_height,\n    y = vb_gender$losing_height,\n    method = \"paired\"\n  )\n\n  ## Print d\n  print(paste(\"My Cohen's d:\", round(d, 3)))\n  print(paste(\"lsr Cohen's d:\", round(d_2, 3)))\n}\n\n[1] \"My Cohen's d: 0.129\"\n[1] \"lsr Cohen's d: 0.129\"\n[1] \"My Cohen's d: 0.094\"\n[1] \"lsr Cohen's d: 0.094\"\n\n\nSo, following Cohen’s conventions, this are negligible effect sizes, so the height differences in professional volleyball are probably not that important for the outcome of the match. Not that surprising all together, because the height differences were very small in the first place, and there are probably much more important factors to winning a volleyball match than a minimal height advantage.",

Violin plots are similar to box plots but have the advantage of conveying more distributional information. If you want, you can also add a small box plot on top of the violin plot to have the advantage of both (you can get some inspiration on how to do that). Give meaningful axis labels and a plot title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nWe want four violin plots/box plots in the end.

The easiest way to achieve this is to build a new column containing the winning information and the gender in one pasted string. This new column can then be used as the x axis.

    "text": "Merging\nTo merge two data frames that include information that belongs together, we need a common column, on which we can combine them. In our case, this is the column containing the country. They are both named region, but one with an upper case R. This doesn’t pose a problem, as we can define which columns should be taken from which data frame for merging. Let’s take a quick look before merging to check if there are any countries named differently in both data sets (this simply combines commands we have already looked at in the Basic operations chapter:\n\nmedal_counts$Region[!(medal_counts$Region %in% world_coordinates$region)]\n\n[1] \"Individual Olympic Athletes\"\n\n\nLooks like all of the countries in our medal_countries data frame can also be found in our world_coordinates frame. Only athletes without a country will be lost when merging, but that’s ok for now, as we are interested in the country specific gold medal counts. So let’s merge:\n\nmedal_countries &lt;- merge(\n  x = medal_counts,\n  y = world_coordinates,\n  by.x = \"Region\",\n  by.y = \"region\",\n  all.x = FALSE,\n  all.y = TRUE\n)\n\nhead(medal_countries)\n\n       Region Medal  n     long      lat group order subregion\n1 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.89131 37.23164     2    12      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.84023 37.22505     2    13      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.76738 37.24917     2    14      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.73896 37.28564     2    15      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.72666 37.29072     2    16      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.66895 37.26670     2    17      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nNote that we also used the all.x and all.y arguments. In this example, we want to take all rows from the second data set, but only those from the first data set, that have a match in the second data set. This is necessary, because we want to plot all countries later on, but only those we have coordinates for, because they won’t show up on the map otherwise.\nWe can also use the tidyverse for this operation. In order to do that, we first have to rename our region column, as the column names need to be the same over both data sets that are merged. left_join() means that we will merge onto the first data set (world_coordinates in the code below), like we have done using the all.x and all.y arguments in the merge() function.\n\n\nmedal_countries &lt;- world_coordinates %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Region\" = region) %&gt;%\n  left_join(medal_counts)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(Region)`\n\nhead(medal_countries)\n\n       long      lat group order Region subregion Medal  n\n1 -69.89912 12.45200     1     1  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n2 -69.89571 12.42300     1     2  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n3 -69.94219 12.43853     1     3  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n4 -70.00415 12.50049     1     4  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n5 -70.06612 12.54697     1     5  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n6 -70.05088 12.59707     1     6  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n\n\n\nGreat!

    "text": "Absolute paths vs. relative paths\nI can head to a specific file by using the full path (absolute path): \"C:\\Users\\hafiznij\\Documents\\GitHub\\r_tutorial\\raw_data\\winners.rda\". This approach has some disadvantages: it will only work on my notebook. If I want to continue my project on another device, I will have to change the path. The same goes for other people who want to work with my project. So, to keep these paths more reproducable, we should always use relative paths: \".\\raw_data\\winners.rda\". This will always work independently of the device I am working on, as long as I am in the correct working directory.\nThe working directory is the path R is currently working in. I can obtain it by typing:\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/home/runner/work/introduction-to-R/introduction-to-R/qmd/load_data\"\n\n\nLuckily, we have already created a RStudio project, which sets the working directory automatically, so we don’t really have to deal with that.\nNow take a look at the working directory and the relative path I used for loading the winners.rda. Notice something? Correct, both paths combined equal the absolute path to the file. So by splitting it up, we obtain a more reproducible path, that works independently of where the current working directory is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe here package\n\n\n\nAnother great way to deal with the path confusion is to use the here package. It can build the paths relative to the directory where your R Studio project is saved in. For example, \".\\raw_data\\winners.rda\" becomes here::here(\"raw_data\", \"winners.rda\"). This is not incredibly important right now, especially if you have all your files in the same folder. But it can become very valuable with increasing project complexity and file structure, so look into it if you want to get a head start! I also I have to use it sometimes during the tutorial because of the way I have organized my project, so don’t be confused! It is just another way to build file paths. Look here (:D) if you want to learn more about the package.",

It should be mentioned that Base R also has some powerful plotting functions, however, ggplot2 makes it very easy to build complex and beautiful plots.\nA ggplot is constructed from multiple layers that can be laid over each other using the + operator.\nWe start with the function ggplot(), in which we define our data and the x and y axes. This will draw our (empty) coordinate system. We have to use the aes() (aesthetics) function for everything that changes in relation to the data. For example, the exact location of each element in the plot is dependent on the x and y position deposited in the data, so we have to specify our axes inside the aes() function:\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = babynames_F_max,\n  aes(\n    x = year,\n    y = percentage)\n  )\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have defined our aesthetics, we can add a geom-layer. This will make use of the data we have defined in ggplot() and plot some bars for us:\n\np +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also define different colors for different groups. For example, if we want the bars to get filled with a color corresponding to the name they are representing, we can do that:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = name))\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted all bars to have the same color, we would have specified the fill argument outside of the aes() function, because in that case, it wouldn’t have to change in dependence of our data. We could also have defined our fill argument in the aes() function we have defined in ggplot(). In that case, it would have influenced all geom_() functions. Because we defined it in geom_col(), it only influences this geom_col() call.\nLet’s give the axes some more informative names and a title to the plot:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  ggtitle(\"Most common female name in the United States of America by year\") +\n  xlab(\"Birthyear\") +\n  ylab(\"Percentage of newborn children with that name\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to style the plot a bit, let’s add a predefined theme and a color palette:\n\np +\n  theme_bw() + # Theme\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") # Color palette\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would have many more options to style this plot further (for example we could sort the names in the legend by order of appearance), but let’s keep it at that for now.",
